/* 
Imposters! -

There are imposters among the group...Find them and remove them!!

Given a string of characters, get rid of all the imposters! All imposters are any characters that AREN'T lower case alphabetical characters OR characters that are 
within parentheses!! So any characters between parentheses should NOT be removed. The parentheses should be removed to let the characters within rejoin the group!

EXAMPLE - 
                      OUTPUT
"HelloMyNam(3!)1s"   ---------> "elloyam3!s"

export function removeImposters(str) {
